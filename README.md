# Cologne Zoo

## This will be a short documentation on all the information necessary for a zookeeper to maintain the platform.

### Installing dependencies

`npm i` should install all the dependencies

### Run the platform

`npm run dev` should start the project normally

### Testing

After adding your own tests to the project, or trying out the existing ones, you can run `npm run test` to test your code.

###### Greetings

If you want to get greeted (you are the admin zookeeper after all), type `npm run hello`.
